# AI Math Tutor

## What This Is

A personalized AI math tutor designed for middle school students learning to solve word problems. Instead of just giving answers or showing steps, this tutor identifies exactly where knowledge gaps exist and fills them—then guides students back to tackle the original problem with confidence.

## The Problem

When students struggle with math word problems, it's often not because the current problem is too hard—it's because they're missing foundational skills from earlier concepts. Traditional tutoring either:
- Walks through the specific problem without addressing underlying gaps
- Requires students (or tutors) to manually identify what prerequisite skills are missing

## How It Works

### Intelligent Skill Analysis

The tutor analyzes each math problem to identify the core skill required, then maps it against a hierarchical skill tree showing:
- What foundational sub-skills support that main skill
- How those sub-skills break down into even simpler concepts
- Multiple layers of prerequisite knowledge

### Adaptive Learning Path

When a student struggles, the tutor determines whether they:
1. **Understand the fundamentals but need guidance** → Provides Socratic questioning to help them work through the current problem
2. **Have gaps in prerequisite knowledge** → Identifies the specific missing sub-skills and generates personalized practice problems tailored to their interests

### Mastery-Based Progression

Built on mastery learning principles, the tutor:
- Creates targeted exercises to build proficiency in weak areas
- Personalizes problem context based on student interests to increase engagement
- Returns to the original problem once foundational skills are solid
- Guides students through solving the original problem with their newly strengthened skills

## Why It Matters

This approach combines:
- **Socratic method**: Helping students discover solutions through guided questioning
- **Diagnostic precision**: Pinpointing exactly which building blocks are missing
- **Mastery learning**: Ensuring solid understanding before moving forward
- **Personalization**: Meeting each student where they are and adapting to their needs

The result is lasting understanding rather than memorized procedures—students learn not just how to solve one problem, but how to think mathematically.
